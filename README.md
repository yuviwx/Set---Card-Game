## Project Overview

This project implements a simplified version of the game "Set" in Java, focusing on concurrent programming concepts and unit testing. The game involves finding combinations of three cards that constitute a "legal set" based on their features. The project provides a framework for game logic, player interactions, and graphical user interface, with the main goal being the implementation of game logic components.

## Features

- Generates a deck of 81 cards with various features: color, number, shape, and shading.
- Players aim to find sets of three cards where each feature is either all the same or all different.
- Supports both human and non-human players.
- Includes graphical representation and keyboard input handling.
- Utilizes Java threads and synchronization mechanisms for concurrent gameplay.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Maven installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Compile the project using Maven: `mvn compile`
5. Run the project: `mvn exec:java`

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the game. Human players can use the designated keys on the keyboard to place or remove tokens from cards. Non-human players are simulated by threads that produce random key presses.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.
- Refer to the provided documentation and source code for detailed implementation guidelines.
- For any questions or issues, refer to the course forum or contact the project maintainer.
